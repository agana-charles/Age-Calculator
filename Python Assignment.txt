Write a Python program that does the following:
 
Input: Ask the user to enter their full name with extra spaces at the beginning and end.
Example: " John Doe "
 
Cleaning:
 
Use strip() to remove the spaces.
 
Use upper() to convert it to uppercase.
 
Print the cleaned name.
 
Splitting and Accessing:
 
Use split() to separate the first and last names.
 
Print each part on a new line using formatted strings (f-strings).
 
Concatenation:
 
Concatenate the first name and last name with a hyphen in between.
 
Print the result.
 
Length:
 
Print the number of characters in the full name (excluding spaces).
 
Bonus (Optional):
 
Reverse the name using string slicing.
 
Check if the name contains the letter 'a' (case-insensitive).
 
 
Enter your full name:    John Doe   
 
Cleaned Name: JOHN DOE
 
First Name: JOHN

Last Name: DOE
 
Concatenated: JOHN-DOE
 
Length (without spaces): 7
 
Reversed: EOD NHOJ
 
Contains 'a'?: False
